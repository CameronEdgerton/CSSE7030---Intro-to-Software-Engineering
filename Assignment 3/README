This assignment required me to build the complete GUI and background code for a Pokemon-themed minesweeper game (see task sheet).

The only thing provided were the images. 

All classes / methods were self-coded.

It includes two different modes (which can be changed by altering the 'task' variable to TASK_ONE or TASK_TWO in the PokemonGame init).

It also features save / load game, highscores and a timer. 

All features in the task sheet for post-graduate students were implemented.

Run a3 to play the game.

I received 23.65587/25 (94.62%) for this assignment.
